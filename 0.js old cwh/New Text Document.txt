JS Introduction
 
What is Programming?
It is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English, or Bengali can be used to talk to a human but for computers, we need straightforward instructions.

Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

 

What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!

It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.

 
intro:
ECMAScript Versions: 
Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.

ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997. 
ECMAScript 2015 also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major revision to JavaScript was made.
The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in 2022.
 
What is Babel?
There are still some ES6 features that aren't supported by all modern browsers. Using Babel is one way of overcoming this problem.

Babel is a preprocessor for ECMAScript.
It is a powerful tool for using the newest features of ECMAScript.
Babel converts ES5+ code into a backward-compatible format.

JS Execution
 
Do we need to install Javascript?
The answer is NO. 

JavaScript is present everywhere in browsers, on your phone, etc.

 

How to execute JavaScript?
JavaScript can be executed right inside one’s browser. You can open the JS console and start writing JS there.

 

Another way to execute JS is a runtime like Node.js which can be installed and used to run JavaScript code.

 

Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside the <script> tag of an HTML document.
